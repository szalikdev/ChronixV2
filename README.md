## Common Issues & Solutions

### ➤ Frequent Desyncs from Public Sessions
- ChronixV2 does **not** currently include a BattlEye bypass to play with other players.
- Without a bypass, legitimate hosts will eventually remove you due to a heartbeat failure.
- **Solution**: There is no current fix without using a private bypass.

### ➤ Progress Lost After Removing FSL
- FSL reroutes account save data to your local hard disk.
- Progress made while using FSL will **only appear** when FSL is enabled.
- **Solution**: Re-enable FSL to recover your progress or continue without it, knowing the save states are separate.

### ➤ Game Fails to Start After Removing FSL
- This is a known issue.
- **Solution**: Delete the following directory:
